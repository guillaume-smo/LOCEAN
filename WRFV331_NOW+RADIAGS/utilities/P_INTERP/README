p_interp will interpolate WRF-ARW netCDF output files to user specified pressure levels.

------------- Compile ------------------------------

A netCDF library is needed for compiling the code.  The MPI library is needed for running 
parallel.  There are many options for compiling at the top of p_interp.F90.

Serial Compile

      pgf90 p_interp.F90 -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf -lm  \
      -I/usr/local/netcdf/include  -Mfree  -o p_interp

Parallel Compile:

      mpxlf_r -qfree=f90 -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf -lm \
      -I/usr/local/netcdf/include -o p_interp p_interp.F90 -WF,-D_MPI

If successful, this will create an executable called p_interp.

------------- Namelist Options ----------------------

New options in the namelist:

 met_em_output  = .FALSE.   Set to .TRUE. to calculate and output fields needed in
                            a met_em file.  These files are used as input to real.exe.
 split_output   = .FALSE.   Set to .TRUE. to output each time in the input file to
                            a separate file.
 mpi_debug      = .FALSE.   Set to .TRUE. for additional output that may be helpful
                            when debugging parallel code.


Info about running with met_em_output = .TRUE..  Other options need to be set in the namelist:

split_output = .TRUE.
unstagger_grid = .FALSE.
extrapolate = 1
process = 'all'

If you forget to set any of the first 3 options, they will be reset automatcially in the code.
If process is set to 'list', the code will stop and the user will have to set process to 'all'.

p_interp will stop if met_em files already exist.  This is to avoid overwriting any met_em files
created by metgrid.exe.

------------- Run ------------------------------

To run serially:

unix> p_interp

To run parallel (Aix):

      mpirun.lsf p_interp
